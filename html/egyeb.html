                    <p class="szoveghatter">János Neumann was born in Budapest on December 28, 1903, perhaps the world's most famous Hungarian mathematician, who during his career enriched the science of not only mathematics, but also physics, chemistry and IT with numerous
                        discoveries. During Neumann's three decades of work, he also made epoch-making discoveries in the field of set theory, game theory and quantum mechanics, while laying the theoretical and practical foundations of IT.</p>
                    <p class="szoveghatter">From 1927 he taught as a private teacher at the University of Berlin, and after Rudolf Ortvay unsuccessfully tried to get the already internationally recognized genius a job in Szeged in 1929, the young man soon traveled to the New
                        World as a guest speaker. János Neumann was barely 28 years old when he was appointed a professor at Princeton University - he was the earliest in the history of the United States to receive this title - and as a result, he permanently
                        settled abroad down, and in 1937 he received American citizenship. The scientist later took an active part in the successful implementation of the Manhattan Plan, in the development of the atomic bomb, and he also had a lion's
                        share in making this huge source of energy later it was also used for peaceful purposes.

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-4 ">
                        <p class="szoveghatter">It's almost unbelievable, but this abundance of discoveries was condensed into only three decades of work, but the tense pace, coupled with the dangerous accompaniments, exhausted Neumann's energy. The scientist had cancer in his
                            body in 1955 was diagnosed, which was already in the metastatic stage, so its cure seemed hopeless; the world-famous professor, weakened by his illness, received the most prestigious American recognition from President Eisenhower,
                            and the Fermi Prize, and soon went to the hospital, where he ended his life in February 1957. In the person of János Neumann, he is one of the most brilliant representatives of Hungarian scientific history, one of the greatest
                            mathematicians of the 20th century left, whose knowledge and expertise - in a painful way - our country had to be without until the end. </p>
